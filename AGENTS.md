This is a blog for a very technical audience. Blog entries are concise and to the point. Just enough background info is provided to set context, but no more. Links are provided for interested readers to read further. Blog is hosted on GitHub and processed by Jekyll.

## Style

- First-person pronouns ("I", "we") are avoided. Use impersonal or imperative style instead (e.g. "Create a file..." not "We create a file...").
- Key technologies and tools are linked inline on first mention (e.g. `[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)`).
- Intro paragraph sets up the problem and the solution in a few sentences, then a short transition sentence outlines the structure of the post.
- Section headers use `#` (H1).
- Each code block is preceded by a one- or two-sentence lead-in explaining what the code does and where the file goes.
- Posts end with a link to a companion GitHub repo or notebook when one exists, not a summary or conclusion paragraph.
